# Concerns & Technical Debt

## Critical Limitations

### 1. No Real Integrations ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Issue**: All screening and verification is **simulated**.

**Impact**:
- Sanctions screening not connected to real databases (OFAC, UN, EU, UK HMT)
- PEP screening not connected to World-Check, Dow Jones, or similar
- Company verification not connected to Companies House API
- All "screening results" are generated by the skill, not from actual sources

**For Production**:
- Requires API integrations with screening providers
- Estimated effort: Significant (weeks to months)
- Cost: Subscription fees for data providers

---

### 2. Educational Use Only ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Issue**: This skill is explicitly stated as **not production-ready**.

**From README**:
> ⚠️ **Educational Tool**: This skill is for training and simulation purposes only

**Missing for Production**:
- [ ] Integration with actual screening databases
- [ ] Human compliance officer review workflow
- [ ] Legal counsel consultation process
- [ ] Core banking system integration
- [ ] Document management systems
- [ ] Case management platforms
- [ ] SAR filing system connection
- [ ] Audit logging infrastructure

## Architectural Concerns

### 3. Prompt-Based Execution

**Issue**: Workflow execution relies entirely on Claude interpreting Markdown.

**Risks**:
- No guaranteed determinism (LLM behavior can vary)
- No type safety for state variables
- No validation of state transitions
- Potential for hallucination or skipped states

**Mitigation (Current)**:
- Detailed instructions in skill.md
- Explicit state machine definition
- Output format templates

**For Production**:
- Consider dedicated workflow engine (e.g., Temporal, AWS Step Functions)
- Implement state machine as actual code
- Add validation at each transition

---

### 4. No State Persistence

**Issue**: Workflow state exists only in Claude's context window.

**Problems**:
- Long workflows may exceed context limits
- State lost if conversation ends unexpectedly
- No resume capability from saved state
- No shared state between sessions

**For Production**:
- Implement state storage (database)
- Add checkpoint/resume capability
- Track workflow progress externally

---

### 5. No Audit Logging

**Issue**: Audit trail is generated in output, not persisted.

**Compliance Requirement**: 
> All KYC records must be retained for minimum 5 years

**Current State**:
- Audit trail only exists in markdown output
- No structured logging
- No timestamp verification
- No tamper-proof records

**For Production**:
- Implement proper audit logging system
- Use immutable storage
- Add cryptographic verification
- Integrate with compliance systems

---

## Risk Scoring Concerns

### 6. Subjective Risk Assessment

**Issue**: Risk scoring relies on Claude's interpretation.

**Problems**:
- Consistency may vary between sessions
- No objective verification of scores
- "Simulated" screening can't provide real risk data

**Example**:
```
Scenario 1 expects score of 15/100
Scenario 2 expects score of 48/100
```
These are illustrative, not calculated from real data.

**For Production**:
- Implement deterministic scoring engine
- Use actual screening data
- Add calibration and validation
- Regular model validation audits

---

### 7. Risk Threshold Hardcoding

**Issue**: Risk tiers are hardcoded in workflow.

```markdown
- LOW (0-30): Standard onboarding
- MEDIUM (31-60): Enhanced due diligence
- HIGH (61-85): Extensive EDD
- PROHIBITED (86-100): Auto-reject
```

**Concerns**:
- No institution-specific customization
- No jurisdiction-specific adjustments
- No product-specific thresholds
- No customer segment differentiation

**For Production**:
- Externalize thresholds to configuration
- Allow per-jurisdiction customization
- Support product-specific risk appetites

---

## Documentation Gaps

### 8. Missing API Documentation

**Issue**: No documentation for integration points.

**Needed**:
- API specifications for screening providers
- Data models for customer information
- Integration patterns for core banking
- Error handling specifications

---

### 9. Incomplete Compliance Mapping

**Issue**: Regulatory requirements mentioned but not mapped.

**Current State**:
- Lists BSA, PATRIOT Act, FATF, etc.
- No detailed requirement-to-state mapping
- No gap analysis
- No evidence of regulatory review

**For Production**:
- Formal compliance mapping
- Legal review of workflow
- Regulatory consultation
- Gap analysis documentation

---

## Quality Concerns

### 10. No Automated Testing

**Issue**: Testing relies on manual scenario execution.

**Current State**:
- 5 sample scenarios documented
- No automated test harness
- No regression testing
- No CI/CD pipeline

**For Production**:
- Implement test automation
- Add regression test suite
- Create output validation scripts
- Integrate with CI/CD

---

### 11. No Error Handling

**Issue**: Workflow assumes happy path.

**Missing**:
- Network failure handling
- Screening timeout handling
- Invalid data handling
- System unavailability handling

**For Production**:
- Add error states to workflow
- Implement retry logic
- Add fallback procedures
- Define escalation for system failures

---

## Maintenance Concerns

### 12. Sanctions List Updates

**Issue**: No process for updating screening lists.

**Compliance Requirement**: Sanctions lists update frequently (daily for OFAC).

**Current State**: Simulated lists, no update mechanism.

**For Production**:
- Automated list synchronization
- Change tracking and alerting
- Retroactive screening triggers

---

### 13. Regulatory Change Management

**Issue**: No process for regulatory updates.

**Risk Areas**:
- FATF grey/black list changes
- New regulations (e.g., new sanctions regimes)
- Jurisdictional rule changes
- Documentation requirement updates

**For Production**:
- Regulatory change monitoring
- Workflow update procedures
- Version control for compliance rules

---

## Security Concerns

### 14. Sensitive Data Handling

**Issue**: No data protection specifications.

**Concerns**:
- PII handling not specified
- No encryption requirements
- No data retention policies (beyond mention of 5 years)
- No access control specifications

**For Production**:
- Implement data classification
- Add encryption requirements
- Define access controls
- Implement data retention policies

---

### 15. No Authentication/Authorization

**Issue**: Skill has no access control.

**Current State**: Anyone can use the skill.

**For Production**:
- Implement user authentication
- Add role-based access control
- Define approval hierarchies
- Audit access to sensitive decisions
