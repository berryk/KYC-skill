This case demonstrates effective verification of legitimate businesses:

1. **Multiple Independent Sources**:
   - Companies House (official registry)
   - Corporate website (business operations)
   - Funding announcements (financial backing)
   - Client case studies (revenue verification)
   - Employee profiles (operational verification)
   - Media coverage (reputation verification)

2. **Institutional Investor Validation**:
   - Presence of reputable VCs (Warburg Pincus, Dawn Capital)
   - Government-backed investors (British Patient Capital, Ontario Teachers')
   - Strategic investors (HSBC, BNY - financial institutions)
   - → Strong signal of legitimacy and due diligence by sophisticated investors

3. **Industry Recognition**:
   - Awards and accolades (SaaS CEO of the Year)
   - Government advisory roles (UK AI Committee)
   - Major client relationships (HSBC, Standard Chartered)
   - → Third-party validation of business legitimacy

4. **Transparent Ownership**:
   - Publicly disclosed funding rounds
   - Named investors and board members
   - Founder shareholding disclosed (12.7%)
   - → Easy to verify, no opacity

5. **Operational Evidence**:
   - Active website with detailed product information
   - Employee presence on LinkedIn (300+)
   - Customer case studies and testimonials
   - Community forums and support channels
   - → Real business operations, not shell company

### Fintech/RegTech Customer Best Practices

**Key Success Factors**:
- ✅ Verify business model against industry norms (SaaS, B2B, recurring revenue)
- ✅ Check funding history and investor quality (VC backing = legitimacy signal)
- ✅ Validate clients (major institutions conducting own vendor DD)
- ✅ Assess industry position (Unicorn status, market leadership)
- ✅ Review Companies House compliance (current filings)
- ✅ LinkedIn employee verification (real headcount)

**Red Flags NOT Present** (contrast with shell companies):
- ❌ No accounts filed → Quantexa ✅ accounts current
- ❌ No online presence → Quantexa ✅ comprehensive website
- ❌ No employees → Quantexa ✅ 300+ on LinkedIn
- ❌ Opaque ownership → Quantexa ✅ transparent VC structure
- ❌ No clients → Quantexa ✅ major institutions (HSBC, etc.)
- ❌ No revenue → Quantexa ✅ £76M reported
- ❌ No business evidence → Quantexa ✅ verified operations
