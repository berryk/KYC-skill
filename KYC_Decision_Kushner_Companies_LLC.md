- Subsidiary: Westminster Management LLC
- CEO: Laurent Morali

**Sanctions Lists Checked**:

### Branch 5b: PEP Screening

**RESULT**: MULTIPLE PEP MATCHES - CRITICAL FINDING

**PEP Findings**:

| Individual | PEP Status | Position | Country | Current/Former | Risk Level |
|------------|------------|----------|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Charles Kushner** | **CURRENT PEP** | US Ambassador to France and Monaco | USA | CURRENT (July 2025-present) | **CRITICAL** |
| **Jared Kushner** | **FORMER PEP** | Senior Advisor to the President | USA | Former (2017-2021) | **HIGH** |

**Analysis**:

1. **Charles Kushner - CURRENT Senior Government Official**:
   - Nominated: November 30, 2024
   - Confirmed by Senate: 51-45 vote
   - Sworn in: July 11, 2025
   - Position: United States Ambassador to France and Monaco
   - **This is a CURRENT, ACTIVE PEP in a senior diplomatic position**

2. **Jared Kushner - Former Senior Government Official**:

- Former senior PEP with ongoing family connections to sitting President
- Both individuals retain beneficial ownership in Kushner Companies

**PEP Risk Score**: 85/100 (CRITICAL - Current senior government official as UBO)

#### Maryland Housing Violations & Settlement

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Plaintiff** | Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh |

- MLRO may determine risk is unacceptable

### Recommendation

Given the critical risk factors identified:
- **CURRENT PEP** (US Ambassador) as beneficial owner
- **Criminal history** of founder (pardoned but not expunged)
- **Extensive adverse media** and enforcement actions
- **Ongoing investigations** at congressional level
- **Complex, opaque** ownership structure

**This case should be escalated to MLRO for risk appetite assessment BEFORE committing significant resources to EDD documentation collection.**

The MLRO should determine whether:
1. The institution wishes to pursue this customer given the risk profile
2. The commercial opportunity justifies the compliance burden
3. The institution is prepared for the reputational exposure
