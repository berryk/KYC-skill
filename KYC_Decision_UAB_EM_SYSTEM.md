## COMPREHENSIVE SCREENING ANALYSIS

### Screening Risk Score: 100/100 (PROHIBITED)

#### 1. Sanctions Screening (Weight: 40%)
- **Score**: 100/100
- **Finding**: TRUE POSITIVE across multiple jurisdictions (EU, US, UK, Switzerland, Lithuania)
- **Assessment**: 50% beneficial owner is designated person on multiple sanctions lists
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Auto-rejection required

- **Finding**: Aleksandr Shakutin identified as close associate of Politically Exposed Person
- **PEP**: Alexander Lukashenko (President of Belarus, designated as dictator/authoritarian leader)
- **Relationship**: Described as "Lukashenko's wallet," close ally, supporter of repressive regime

#### 3. Adverse Media Screening (Weight: Not applicable - superseded by sanctions)
- **Findings**: Extensive negative media coverage
  - "Lukashenka's sanctioned 'wallet' Shakutsin continues business in the EU in spite of sanctions" (investigatebel.org, 2024)
  - "EU court backs sanctions on Belarusian oligarch" (Courthouse News Service, 2024)

- **Lithuanian Banks**: Enforced asset freeze on company accounts
- **Advocate General Opinion** (July 2025): Opined that 50% ownership may create rebuttable presumption of control, allowing provisional freezes pending due diligence

|--------|------------|
| **FATF Status** | Compliant (MONEYVAL member) |

| **AML/CFT Framework** | Sound, improvements ongoing |
| **Overall Jurisdictional Risk** | LOW (20/100) |

|--------|------------|
| **Sector** | Automotive parts retail/wholesale |
| **High-Risk Sector** | No (standard commercial activity) |
| **Business Model Transparency** | Unclear - allegations of sanctions evasion |

## FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT

**Risk Rating**: PROHIBITED

**Risk Calculation**:
- Screening Risk (40%): 100 × 0.40 = **40 points**

- Business Activity Risk (25%): 80 × 0.25 = **20 points**
- Customer Profile (10%): 100 × 0.10 = **10 points** (sanctions exposure overrides all other factors)
- **Sanctions Override**: Auto-escalation to PROHIBITED (100/100)

## LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

### EU Court Case C-84/24: Impact on Decision

**Case Status**: Pending before EU Court of Justice (filed February 2024)

**Legal Question**: Whether funds and economic resources of a company should be frozen when a designated person holds exactly 50% of shares

**Advocate General Opinion** (July 3, 2025):
- Asset freeze on designated person does not **automatically** extend to non-listed company
- However, 50% ownership creates **rebuttable presumption** of control
- Banks may **provisionally freeze** assets while conducting further due diligence
- Company must demonstrate designated person does NOT control funds/economic resources

**Impact on KYC Decision**:
- **NO IMPACT** - This case concerns EU sanctions application within EU jurisdiction
- U.S. financial institutions must comply with **U.S. OFAC regulations** independently
- OFAC's 50% rule: U.S. persons prohibited from dealing with entities 50%+ owned by SDNs
- Shakutin's 50% ownership meets OFAC threshold for prohibition
- **Additionally**: Entity is subject to Lithuanian national sanctions (separate from ownership question)
- **Additionally**: Shakutin is also on OFAC SDN list, UK sanctions, and Swiss sanctions

**Conclusion**: Even if EU court rules in company's favor, U.S. bank obligations under OFAC remain unchanged.

---

## DECISION RATIONALE

### Why This Application Must Be Rejected

**Primary Reason**: OFAC Sanctions Compliance

Under OFAC's 50 Percent Rule:
> "U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with individuals or entities that are 50 percent or more owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more blocked persons."

- Aleksandr Shakutin is a blocked person (OFAC SDN List, BELARUS-EO14038)
- UAB "EM SYSTEM" is 50% owned by Aleksandr Shakutin
- Therefore, UAB "EM SYSTEM" is a blocked entity under the 50 Percent Rule
- U.S. financial institutions cannot open accounts or conduct transactions with blocked entities

**Secondary Reasons**:

1. **Multiple Sanctions Jurisdictions**: Entity's beneficial owner is sanctioned by EU, US, UK, Switzerland - indicating global consensus on prohibition

2. **Active Asset Freeze**: Lithuanian banks have already frozen the company's accounts (€14 million), demonstrating that the entity is subject to sanctions enforcement in its home jurisdiction

3. **Sanctions Evasion Concerns**: Credible investigative journalism reports that this entity is being used to evade sanctions and conduct prohibited business activities in Germany

4. **Reputational Risk**: Association with "Lukashenko's wallet" and support for repressive authoritarian regime creates unacceptable reputational risk for the bank

5. **Regulatory Risk**: Onboarding this customer would expose the bank to:
   - OFAC civil penalties (up to $330,120 per violation or 2x transaction value)
   - OFAC criminal penalties (up to $1,000,000 per violation)
   - Regulatory enforcement actions
   - Consent orders and compliance monitoring
   - License revocation risk

### Risk-Based Approach

FATF risk-based approach requires enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers. However, when a customer presents PROHIBITED risk due to sanctions, **no amount of due diligence can mitigate the risk**. The only compliant action is rejection.
